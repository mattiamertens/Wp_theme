                This is the story of how I got my strange but beautiful snapback hat and how it is one of the things that most define me. 
                It all started back in 2016 in Australia, more precisely in Melbourne at the Fitzroy Social. 
                I went out for the night with a friend and in this pub, they gave you a free Corona Extra hat (yes, the beer nobody likes) 
                upon purchase of an entire bucket of beers. I didn’t really want to spend all that money, so I kind of told an 
                “alternative truth” to the barkeeper, convincing him I bought the beers but they told me go and ask for the hat at the other counter because they ran out. 
                And there it happened, he as careless as it could be, gave me my new life companion. <br><br>

            <div class="title exp_title">As Polimi <br> started </div>
            <div class="description">
            My hat has always come with me since I moved to Milan and started to dig my own grave, ehm, I mean my bachelor degree studies. 
            He was always by my side since the very first project, he went with me through several exams and is for me a talisman. 
            My belief in him is so strong that once, I repaired the little plastic mechanism literally stitching it back together, 
            making it a one size but at least wearable.

            <div class="description">
            Since the blue fella had always stuck around, I decided that he earned the right to come with 
            me in one of my furthest travels, so we went to Japan. Sure enough he was grinding miles, 
            from ’Straya to Italy, then a little bit around Europe and now back to Asia. It turned out that bringing 
            the snapback with me had been one of most crucial decisions I made. So, my friends and I decide to book our 
            flights on the 16th of August, encountering the hottest and most humid weather of the entire year, 
            but that made it the cheapest season ever. There I really understood why people crossing the desert wear 
            thick clothing and headgear. <br><br>
